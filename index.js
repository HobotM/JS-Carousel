// Task:
// - Wire up the buttons to switch through the images in the imgs array. 
// - Make sure that the gallery works no matter how many images are added.
// - Decide/implement what to do when you reach either end of the array - do nothing and disable buttons, loop back round to the other end, or something else?
// - Remember to also update the alt tags.

// Stretch goals:
// - Add transitions for a smooth effect.
// - Allow the user to zoom in and out of the images.
